   <h2>Rattle snake pasta</h2>
   <p>So I first tried this at Uno's (Shout out to Uno's) and the flavor was insane. Since then
   however its been lack luster. I love the jalepeno's in them however spicy is user variated so
   make it to your liking.</p>
   <p>Rattle snake pasta has a creamy consistency that when garnished with seasoning you have a
   palatable presentation.</p>
   <ul>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <li>Pasta</li>
    <li>2 - Tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
    <li>3/4 - cup sliced mushrooms (Optional)</li>
    <li>1/2 - cup zucchini, cut diagonally into 1/2 inch thick slices</li>
    <li>1/2 - cup of chopped yellow squash</li>
    <li>1/4 - cup of sliced onions</li>
    <li>1 & 1/4 - cups heavy cream</li>
    <li>1 Jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced</li>
    <li>1 - tablespoon Dijon mustard</li>
    <li>1 - tablespoon Cajun seasoning</li>
    <li>1 - teaspoon minced garlic</li>
    <li>1/2 - cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    <li>1/2 - cup diced tomatoes</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    <li>3 - tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1 - pound rattlesnake meat, cut into 1/2 inch pieces. You can totally substitute this
    for chicken.</li>
    <li>All-purpose flour for dredging</li>
   </ul>
   <ol>
       <h3>Steps</h3>
       <li>Cook pasta: Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Cook fettuccine in boiling water until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; drain.</li>
       <li>Make sauce: Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir mushrooms, zucchini, squash, and onions in hot oil until vegetables are heated through but still firm, about 5 minutes. Pour in cream and cooked fettuccine; simmer for 4 minutes. Mix in jalape√±o, mustard, Cajun seasoning, and garlic; cook for 1 minute. Stir in Parmesan cheese and tomatoes. Reduce heat to low to keep warm.</li>
       <li>Meanwhile, cook rattlesnake: Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat. Dredge rattlesnake meat in flour and fry in hot oil until cooked through, about 5 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of meat should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Arrange on top of pasta to serve.</li>
